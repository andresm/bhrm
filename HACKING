Unfortunaely I do  no have access to  more HRM models, nor do  I own a
Speedbox so  the distance and  height data is  not solved yet,  and it
seems it wont.

If you do have more sofisticated models then you can try to write the
data adquisition and interpretation yourself.

To get  the data use the  beurer.py module, by default  it will output
the read  data as binary  data. If you  want to visualize the  data as
ascii you can use the -a flag.

The comunication with the HRM is done by "sections".  One by one, each
section is requested to the HRM. Each type of section is identified by
the first byte of the data.

The HRM  is the one  in charge of  dictating the message  order, every
message except initial one is mandated by the HRM using the first byte
of the last response.

The best way to analize new  sections is to dump the communication log
to a  file, this is very  different than dumping the  data alone.  The
communication log is  very explicit and self explanatory.  To dump the
log, use  the -v  1 flag.  Remember that by  default beurer.py  do not
delete the data from the HRM.

As soon  as you have  the data  from the HRM  you can start  trying to
interpret the sections not yet finished.
